'''Dynamic Filter notes'''


in FilterContainer.vue use the input property of the filters, @input="(value) => filterChange(filter.name, value)"
in order to wait for input, 
the filters are pulled from state.filterObjects.filter where they are pulled from the filterDefinitions.js
from mutations.js use func UpdateFilter (state, { name, value, router }) to update filter.selection and filter.label

in state.js create empty countryDictionary
in state.js create empty countrylist (used in SetCountryList, but can be done without setting state variabel)
in state.js create filterObjects

in action.js filter accoring to your wanted attributes
('/api/data/eu_bbmri_eric_collections?filter=id,biobank(id,name,label),name,country,label,parent_collection&expand=biobank&size=10000&sort=biobank_label')
get all date and feed it to func SetCountryList in mutations.js
SetCountryLists gets the current state and the filteroptions

in getCollectionInfo commit 'SetCountryList'

and never ever dare to forget the COLLECTION_ATTRIBUTE_SELECTOR :D  (in action.js)
und COLLECTION_REPORT_ATTRIBUTE_SELECTOR
